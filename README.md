# Animal Behavior Agent - Savanna Simulation

A sophisticated 3D animal behavior simulation that creates a dynamic savanna ecosystem with AI-powered animals exhibiting realistic behaviors, social interactions, and survival instincts.

## üåç Overview

This application simulates a living savanna ecosystem where animals interact with each other and their environment in real-time. Each animal has unique personalities, daily routines, and decision-making capabilities powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). The simulation features realistic terrain generation, weather cycles, hunting behaviors, social dynamics, and breeding systems.
